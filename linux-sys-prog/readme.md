### Linux System Call of the Day

---

In 2025, [Uros Popovic](https://popovicu.com/) started "Linux System Call of the Day" series on [X.com/Twitter](https://x.com/popovicu94) where he breaks down one of these syscalls (the vital API that lets your userspace programs ask the Linux kernel) to perform powerful operations.<br>

I'm a huge fan of this series and thought we should save these posts in a folder for reading / reference.
