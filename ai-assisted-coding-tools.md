## AI-assisted Tools

AI-assited tools for software development life-cycle (SDLC) is a rapidly evolving space.

Using this page to save quick notes about various tools as I hear about them.<br>
Please note that this is **not** meant to be an exaustive list.

- [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills)<br>
  • Originally developed by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/).<br>
  • A simple, open format for giving agents new capabilities and expertise.<br>
  • Consists of folders of simple open format instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and use to do things more accurately and efficiently.


- [roborev](https://www.roborev.io/) [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/roborev-dev/roborev)<br>
  • Continuously reviews your agents’ commits.<br>
  • Run targeted reviews with your own prompts.<br>
  • Works with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, OpenCode, and Droid.<br>
  • Allows for autonomously addressing reviews in a branch or commit range with your preferred agent.

  roborev can now analyze and systematically refactor your code for you — this is essential to managing the poor code quality of agents in rapidly expanding agentic code bases. Game changer<br>

  it runs locally!!<br>Local is faster and immediate. Review much more often and use reviews in your agent sessions
