## Code Review

- [roborev](https://www.roborev.io/) [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/roborev-dev/roborev)<br>
  • Continuously reviews your agents’ commits.<br>
  • Run targeted reviews with your own prompts.<br>
  • Works with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, OpenCode, and Droid.<br>

  roborev can now analyze and systematically refactor your code for you — this is essential to managing the poor code quality of agents in rapidly expanding agentic code bases. Game changer<br>

  it runs locally!!<br>Local is faster and immediate. Review much more often and use reviews in your agent sessions
